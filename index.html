                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Franz Fernando.  I'm currently Software Engineer  from Lambda School.  I have experience working with many of todays both Javascript and Python frameworks like, React, Redux, node, Django.  I have experience programming in C, Relational Database Management Systems, MongoDB, MySQL and I am proficient with Firebase.  I also have a background in electronics, particularly in digital and analog circuits.  I have experience with multiple stages of the manufacturing process whether during the early prototype stages or during production. This process includes tasks such as testing, developing testing apparatus and procedures, drafting schematic diagrams and service manuals, circuit board design, troubleshooting and repair, and quality control.  After years of dealing with the hardware side of things, I began to dabble with the software side  and that is what sparked my inteterest in programming.  Lambda School is providing me with a great opportunity to bridge the knowledge I have on the hardware side  with the software side of it all. I really believe in  the craft of software engineering, and am pragmatic when necessary.  I am very passionate about learning and equally as passionate about helping others learn as well.
